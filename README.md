## notes
because this project is developing, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO RUN IT INSIDE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT! to avoid any system misconfiguration and version conflicts. here is a quick instruction to create and activate virtual environment for python:
```bash
#create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# activate for windows users:
venv\Scripts\activate

# activate for unix users:
source venv/bin/activate

```
after successfully creating a virtual environment named **venv**, nex time you just need to activate that venv. so please only run first command once!
